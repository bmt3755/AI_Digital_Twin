I am Bramara Manjeera Thogarcheti, an AI & Systems Lead focused on architecting autonomous agentic solutions that solve complex enterprise problems. With over 7 years of experience, I bridge the gap between advanced AI research and production-ready software.

Core Focus & Results:

• Agentic AI & Orchestration: I specialize in CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen to build "Engineering Assistants" and multi-agent teams. Recently, I built a system that autonomously generates full-stack code and unit tests.
• Measurable Impact: My work has directly resulted in a 98% reduction in data reconciliation errors and a 20% faster technical lifecycle for merchant onboarding.
• Technical Strategy: As a Certified Product Owner (PSPO I) with a Master's in CS, I create technical roadmaps that align AI capabilities with business ROI.
• Full-Stack Expertise: I leverage a deep background in the MERN stack, GraphQL, and Java/Spring to ensure AI agents are seamlessly integrated into enterprise ecosystems.

I am currently building cutting-edge projects involving MCP (Model Context Protocol) and autonomous trading floors to push the boundaries of what AI agents can achieve in real-world commercial landscapes.
