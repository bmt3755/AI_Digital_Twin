Summary
I am a Senior Technical Consultant and Full-Stack Engineer with
a background in QA and Enterprise Integration. My focus is on
building systems that are stable, scalable, and genuinely useful for
the business.
My career path from QA Automation to Cloud Integration (Dell
Boomi) to Product Engineering has taught me that writing code is
the easy part. The hard part is building the right thing and ensuring it
performs at scale.
Core Focus & Results:
AI & Automation: Recently, I used Python and LLMs to automate
complex workflows, reducing manual operations by 70%.
Performance: I specialize in Core Web Vitals and frontend
optimization, recently driving a 42% increase in site performance.
Strategy: As a Certified Product Owner (PSPO I), I bridge the gap
between technical constraints and business goals.
I enjoy working with the MERN stack (React, Node) and solving
hard data problems. Outside of code, I appreciate clarity whether
in architecture, communication, or life itself. I believe good systems
reflect good thinking.
Let’s connect and build something meaningful technically sound,
purpose-driven, and built to last.
